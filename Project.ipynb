    "## Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the project is to simulate the real-world process of deploying machine learning models.  Specifically, the project component of this course allows you to explore a technology that assists in model deployment/tracking, either directly or indirectly, and asks you to report your experience working with that technology (or multiple technologies) to achieve some overall deployment goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Try out a technology (or a specific aspect of it) related to the ML lifecycle. Compare it with its competitors (e.g., MLFlow vs bentoml vs cortex, or Heroku vs Dokku vs EC2/DigitalOcean). Document this process in a very clear and well thought out manner.\n"

    "During the lecture session as shown in the syllabus page, each team will provide a 10 minute walk-through (discussing highlights/demo) of their project and their learnings from the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Report and Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Each team should upload a zip of all deliverables to Blackboard before the deadline. The deliverables are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Project Report: In at most 8 pages (12 point, single column; you can have an appendix for supplementary material that may or may not be checked), you should explain your  project in sufficient technical depth.\n",
    " - Code and data: Code associated with the project (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, py files, requirements.txt Dockerfiles etc), a small sample of the data/inputs/outputs (if needed), and all steps necessary to replicate the project should be provided along with/in the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "All external material/sources (code/idea/theory/insights) used should be cited prominently without failure. Use of pre-trained models, databases, web servers, front-end frameworks, visualization tools etc for your project is allowed and encouraged (explicit consideration of copyrighted material and licenses should be made). This project cannot be used as part of any other course or requirement.\n",

    "   - actual handling of the technology and demonstration in a dev/staging/prod environment\n",
    "   - documenting the experience\n",
    "   - lessons learned\n",
    "   - code artifacts and/or Jupyter notebooks\n",

    "## Grading Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects will be graded based on the creativity shown in handling the technology and the insights drawn in the report. The reports should be very clearly written and presented, and will be evaluated based on the correctness, content, creativity and clarity (equal weights):\n",
    "\n",
    " - Correctness will be assessed based on the correct application of a technology, valid software setup and discussion of choices, technical correctness and the assumptions laid out.\n",
    " - Content will be assessed based on the contributions made in the project (given group size) and project depth (e.g., why this aspect of ML deployment, why this problem, what did you do, clean visualizations and interesting conclusions, insights, clear discussion of methodology followed). You should try to demonstrate your understanding of the relevant topics and their use in your non-trivial project.\n",
    " - Creativity will be assessed based on how no-obvious your solution or contribution is and how different choices were thoughtfully made in the execution of the project.\n",
    " - Clarity will be assessed based on the language quality, layout and structure of the report, the adequacy of the references cited,  the capability of the team in explaining ideas in a clear and professional manner, and the clarity demonstrated in your discussions with the teaching staff etc.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Keep track of infrastructure costs, especially if you are using services that require having a payment mode on file. If possible, try to use free resources.\n",
    "- Do not train expensive models (deep neural networks) from scratch if it can be avoided. The project should not be centered around model accuracy.\n"
