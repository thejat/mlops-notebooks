    "\n",
    "- Term, CRN and Number of Credits: Fall 2024,  49499 (IDS 568) and 2 resp.\n",
    "- Time: Thurs 6.30 - 9.00 PM\n",
    "- Location: ARC 136\n",
    "- Staff:\n",
    "     - Instructor: [Dr. Theja Tulabandhula](https://theja.org)\n",
    "       - Office Hours: Weekdays 11-3.30pm by prior email appointments at UH 2404/Zoom\n",

    "## 2. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice-oriented course surveys modern best practices around getting machine learning (ML) models into production. It complements IDS 572, IDS 575 and IDS 576, which is to learn multiple ways of operationalizing machine learning workflows and models in the context of the larger business end-goals. The course is also complementary to IDS 561. We will gain a better understanding of strategies for model management, monitoring and deployment. Further, we intertwine these topics with online experimentation techniques (A/B testing) and software engineering ideas such as version control, containerization, and continuous integration/continuous deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tentative list of topics is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploying ML models using web servers (e.g., using Flask)\n",
    "- Containers for machine learning: the Docker ecosystem and Kubernetes\n",
    "- Model management: model tracking logging, scheduling of training, A/B testing\n",
    "- Distributed and streaming setups: Apache Spark and Kafka\n",

    " - The objective will be to demonstrate a deployment of an existing machine learning model that you have access to. A suitable documentation of this process along with the complete set of scripts/codes/commands used is to be submitted on the due date (with no exceptions). See the [project page](Project.ipynb) for the due date and more detailed instructions.\n",
    " - You should form groups of _strictly_ $2$ students each for the project component and update your details in the spreadsheet on [Blackboard](https://uic.blackboard.com). Reach out to your classmates early using the same spreadsheet. Because this is a group project, a commensurate effort is expected, and each member's contributions needs to be explicitly reported in the final submission.\n",

    " - This is a 2 credit graduate level course offered by the Information and Decision Sciences department at UIC.\n",
    " - See the [academic calendar](http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/) for the semester timeline.\n",
    " - Students who wish to observe their religious holidays (http://oae.uic.edu/religious-calendar/) should notify the instructor within one week of the first lecture date. \n",

    "### 7.1 Special Accommodations\n",
    "\n",
    "UIC has the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](https://drc.uic.edu/) to help students needing special accommodations. If you have any condition, such as a physical or learning disability, which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as outlined in the syllabus or which will require academic accommodations, you can go to the DRC for assistance, and should do so at the beginning of the semester or as early as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a student needs remote learning accommodation due to a physical condition, such as if they are immuno-compromised and especially vulnerable to Covid, then the student can submit a formal request for remote learning accommodation through the DRC. This is needed in order to maintain fairness and consistency in our attendance policy."
